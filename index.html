                <p id="about-me1">I’m a former CT tech, with 13.5 years of experience in Radiology and 11.5 years of experience doing CT at a local doctor’s office, managing their CT department. <br>
                One of the things I loved about my job as a CT tech was witnessing how small details could have such a major impact in patient care and diagnosis. As much as my meticulous brain and empathetic personality helped me succeed in this position, I was yearning for a career that would give me a better work-life balance and help me to better support my family. <br>
                I spent about a year playing around with code in my downtime and realized how fulfilling it was creating new things and solving puzzles! I’ve always enjoyed learning and finding ways to make things more efficient and realized software engineering was a good fit for me! After doing some bootcamp research, I realized General Assembly had a proven record of success, and that I was up for this new challenge!

              <p id="about-me2">The Software Engineering Bootcamp with GA has been a one-of-a-kind experience that has shown me what I am really capable of, being able to learn and apply so much information in a short period of time! Creating new projects and watching my passion come to life has been so empowering! I’m looking forward to a future in tech, nurturing my love of learning and creating!<br><br>
                Fun personal facts:<br>I am so blessed to have such an incredible family! My husband and I have 3 beautiful children (2 girls and a boy). We also have a cat and a golden retriever. Both are as equally ornery as they are lovable (that may apply to the kids too)! When I'm not working I love spending time with my family, doing bike rides in the summer on the trail, and watching my kids do what they love! My girls dance competitively and my son plays for several travel sports teams!
